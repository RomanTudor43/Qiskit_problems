# Hackathon Challenges

## General Guidelines

1. **Simulator Usage**:  
   For all challenges involving a simulator, **do not use any Aer simulator options**. Always utilize the default functions provided.

2. **Error Handling**:  
   In the context of these challenges, raising an error means **printing the required message and halting the program's execution**.

3. **Qiskit and Qubit Ordering**:  
   - In Qiskit, the qubit order is reversed compared to the conventional order used in quantum computing. 
   - When designing your circuits, use the gates and qubit placements as you would on paper.  
   - Be aware that the matrix outputs generated by Qiskit may differ from the expected matrices due to its handling of qubit ordering. Unless specified otherwise, the matrix representation of a circuit should align with Qiskitâ€™s output.

## Evaluation and Submission

- After solving each challenge, submit your solutions for evaluation using the provided link: [Submit Solutions Here](https://forms.gle/6PYiqTKk6Twc5cJFA).
- **Scoring**:  
  Your total score will be calculated by summing the individual scores for all problems in this repository.  
- Each notebook includes **visible tests** to assist you with local testing. However, additional **hidden tests** will be run during the evaluation process.

## Environment Setup

We strongly recommend setting up a local environment to ensure compatibility with the specific versions of the packages used in the notebooks.

Good luck with the challenges, and we hope you enjoy solving them!
